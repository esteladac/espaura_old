### Used resources:
- FastLED library for controlling LED strips
- IRremoteESP8266 library for IR remote control
- Using adalight from: https://github.com/Wifsimster/adalight_ws2812
- Using WLED Code to have some ideas on how to code, I'm not copying it, just using it as a reference.
- ChatGPT for ideas, suggestions, and effect code generation, the code is not generated by it, it's written by me.
- Comments for all the file written by Github Copilot, I don't use it for code generation, just for comments.

### Functionalities:
- Adalight mode for HyperHDR compatibility
- Configuration mode for setting LED count, max current, and max framerate
- Manual mode for direct LED control
- IR remote control support for switching modes
- EEPROM storage for configuration persistence
- Serial communication for configuration and debugging
- Built-in LED for status indication
- Modular design for easy expansion and customization

### Future improvements:
- WiFi support for remote configuration and control
- Additional effects and animations for LEDs
